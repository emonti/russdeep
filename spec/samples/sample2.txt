The Tragedy of Macbeth
Shakespeare homepage | Macbeth | Entire play
SCENE I. A desert place.

    Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches 

First Witch

    When shall we three meet again
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch

    When the hurlyburly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.

Third Witch

    That will be ere the set of sun.

First Witch

    Where the place?

Second Witch

    Upon the heath.

Third Witch

    There to meet with Macbeth.

First Witch

    I come, Graymalkin!

Second Witch

    Paddock calls.

Third Witch

    Anon.

ALL

    Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
    Hover through the fog and filthy air.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A camp near Forres.

    Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant 

DUNCAN

    What bloody man is that? He can report,
    As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
    The newest state.

MALCOLM

    This is the sergeant
    Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
    'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
    Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
    As thou didst leave it.

Sergeant

    Doubtful it stood;
    As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
    And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
    The multiplying villanies of nature
    Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
    Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
    And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
    Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
    For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
    Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
    Which smoked with bloody execution,
    Like valour's minion carved out his passage
    Till he faced the slave;
    Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
    Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
    And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

DUNCAN

    O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!

Sergeant

    As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
    Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
    So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
    Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
    No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
    Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
    But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
    With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
    Began a fresh assault.

DUNCAN

    Dismay'd not this
    Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

Sergeant

    Yes;
    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
    If I say sooth, I must report they were
    As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
    Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
    Or memorise another Golgotha,
    I cannot tell.
    But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN

    So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
    They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.

    Exit Sergeant, attended
    Who comes here?

    Enter ROSS

MALCOLM

    The worthy thane of Ross.

LENNOX

    What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
    That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS

    God save the king!

DUNCAN

    Whence camest thou, worthy thane?

ROSS

    From Fife, great king;
    Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
    And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
    With terrible numbers,
    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
    The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
    Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
    Confronted him with self-comparisons,
    Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
    Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
    The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN

    Great happiness!

ROSS

    That now
    Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
    Nor would we deign him burial of his men
    Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
    Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN

    No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
    Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
    And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS

    I'll see it done.

DUNCAN

    What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A heath near Forres.

    Thunder. Enter the three Witches 

First Witch

    Where hast thou been, sister?

Second Witch

    Killing swine.

Third Witch

    Sister, where thou?

First Witch

    A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
    And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
    'Give me,' quoth I:
    'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
    Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat without a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

Second Witch

    I'll give thee a wind.

First Witch

    Thou'rt kind.

Third Witch

    And I another.

First Witch

    I myself have all the other,
    And the very ports they blow,
    All the quarters that they know
    I' the shipman's card.
    I will drain him dry as hay:
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his pent-house lid;
    He shall live a man forbid:
    Weary se'nnights nine times nine
    Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
    Though his bark cannot be lost,
    Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
    Look what I have.

Second Witch

    Show me, show me.

First Witch

    Here I have a pilot's thumb,
    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.

    Drum within

Third Witch

    A drum, a drum!
    Macbeth doth come.

ALL

    The weird sisters, hand in hand,
    Posters of the sea and land,
    Thus do go about, about:
    Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
    And thrice again, to make up nine.
    Peace! the charm's wound up.

    Enter MACBETH and BANQUO

MACBETH

    So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

BANQUO

    How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
    That man may question? You seem to understand me,
    By each at once her chappy finger laying
    Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
    That you are so.

MACBETH

    Speak, if you can: what are you?

First Witch

    All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

Second Witch

    All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!

Third Witch

    All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!

BANQUO

    Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
    Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
    Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
    Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
    You greet with present grace and great prediction
    Of noble having and of royal hope,
    That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
    If you can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not,
    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
    Your favours nor your hate.

First Witch

    Hail!

Second Witch

    Hail!

Third Witch

    Hail!

First Witch

    Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

Second Witch

    Not so happy, yet much happier.

Third Witch

    Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
    So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

First Witch

    Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

MACBETH

    Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
    By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
    But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
    A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
    Stands not within the prospect of belief,
    No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
    You owe this strange intelligence? or why
    Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
    With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

    Witches vanish

BANQUO

    The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
    And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?

MACBETH

    Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
    As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!

BANQUO

    Were such things here as we do speak about?
    Or have we eaten on the insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner?

MACBETH

    Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO

    You shall be king.

MACBETH

    And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

BANQUO

    To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

    Enter ROSS and ANGUS

ROSS

    The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
    The news of thy success; and when he reads
    Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
    His wonders and his praises do contend
    Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
    In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
    Strange images of death. As thick as hail
    Came post with post; and every one did bear
    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
    And pour'd them down before him.

ANGUS

    We are sent
    To give thee from our royal master thanks;
    Only to herald thee into his sight,
    Not pay thee.

ROSS

    And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
    He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
    In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
    For it is thine.

BANQUO

    What, can the devil speak true?

MACBETH

    The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
    In borrow'd robes?

ANGUS

    Who was the thane lives yet;
    But under heavy judgment bears that life
    Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
    With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
    He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
    But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
    Have overthrown him.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
    The greatest is behind.

    To ROSS and ANGUS
    Thanks for your pains.

    To BANQUO
    Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
    When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
    Promised no less to them?

BANQUO

    That trusted home
    Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
    Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
    Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
    In deepest consequence.
    Cousins, a word, I pray you.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Two truths are told,
    As happy prologues to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.

    Aside
    Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
    Why hath it given me earnest of success,
    Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
    If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
    Against the use of nature? Present fears
    Are less than horrible imaginings:
    My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
    Shakes so my single state of man that function
    Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
    But what is not.

BANQUO

    Look, how our partner's rapt.

MACBETH

    [Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
    Without my stir.

BANQUO

    New horrors come upon him,
    Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
    But with the aid of use.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Come what come may,
    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

BANQUO

    Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

MACBETH

    Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
    With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
    Are register'd where every day I turn
    The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
    Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
    The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
    Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO

    Very gladly.

MACBETH

    Till then, enough. Come, friends.

    Exeunt
